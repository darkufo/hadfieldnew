# hadfieldnew

As it seems that Google won't be doing a proper compact mode for us for a while, I thought I'd try to share what I use to give back some of the old GPF power user compact that I know a number of us rely on.

I've used the Chrome Extension Stylebot for this but I've tided up the CSS so that it should work with similar extensions/addons with Firefox/Opera etc

I've also commented the CSS so that you can see what I'm doing and tweak it yourself for your own preferences.

The key things for me here were to 

- Maximize the number of rows displayed
- Removal of the top "slider"
- Removal of the Pinned Topics
- Reducing white space 
- Making Icons such as Duplication, Moved In, Locked etc stand out more
- Square Avatars
- Reduce excessive margins and padding
- Expose the checkboxes for easier access
- Improved Posts and Reply Screens
- Improved padding for new replies 
- Hiding the +1 button
- Author Name more visible for new replies. 
- Replies now full width with the avatars and nav widget outside

You can install Stylebot Here

You can then install my Style here

My only fear here is that the way Google generate their CSS is that the class names will change on each major update. Which will require fixing of the Style code.

Hope you find it useful
